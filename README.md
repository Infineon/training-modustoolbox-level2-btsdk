# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 2 – AIROC™ Bluetooth® SDK (BTSDK) MCUs

This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers MCUs using the BTSDK API.

MCUs that use the BTSDK API include CYW20819, CYW20820, CYW20835, and CYW43012 (in embedded mode). You will find BSPs containing MCUs that use BTSDK in the ModusToolbox™ Project Creator tool in the *AIROC™ Bluetooth® BSPs* section.

The material and examples demonstrate the use of peripherals such as GPIOs, PWMs, ADCs,
UARTs, etc. The use of low power modes is also covered.
